"""Per-guild response-state tracking for voice interruption handling.

This module holds the :class:`ResponseTracker` — a small state machine
that knows whether the familiar is currently idle, generating a reply,
or speaking a reply on a voice channel. It is the prerequisite for the
interruption detector in the same module (added in a later step) and
for cancellable LLM / mid-playback yield logic in ``bot.py``.

Today the tracker is **observational only**: transitions are logged at
INFO but no interrupt dispatch happens yet. The fields are shaped for
the scenarios documented in
``docs/roadmap/interruption-flow.md``.
